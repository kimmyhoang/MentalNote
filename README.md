# Mental Note

Mental Note is a sentiment journal that acts as a personal mood tracker. Users write small notes about their day, and recieve a personalized themed image generated based on the overall sentiment of their input. After use of Mental Note for an extended period of time, the user is able to view a colourful mozaic of their mood over time.
